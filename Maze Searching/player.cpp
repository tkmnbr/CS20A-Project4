//  update() 
//		This function implements an algorithm to look through the maze
//      for places to move (STATE::LOOK). update also handles moving the 
//		player as well, if there is an open undiscovered cell to move to the  
//		player just moves there.  However, there will be cases in the next 
//		desired room to look around is not adjacent (more than one cell away), 
//		at this room the player must backtrack (State::BACKTRACK) to a room 
//		that is adjacent to the next room the player was planning to visit
//
//		The player can only do one thing each call, they can either LOOK or 
//		BACKTRACK not both.  Nor should the player move more than one cell per
//		call to update.  If you examine the function calls for the entire game
//		you should observe that this is already be called within a loop. Your
//		Implementation should NOT have any loops that pertain to actual movement 
//		of the player.  
//
//		Backtracking is challenging, save it for the very very very last thing.
//		Make sure the STATE::LOOK aspect compiles and works first.
